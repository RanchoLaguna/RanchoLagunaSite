      <p>
      Born in California's Bay Area, I moved to Silverdale, Washington with my parents in 1977. As I was growing up, I has always been fortunate to have animals around me. "Mom, they followed me home!" was a very common conversation in our household. I got my first rescue horse when I was 12. His name was Breezie John, and he had nothing but skin and bones. My vet Dr. O'Neil helped me with a feeding plan to rehabilitate and bring Breezie John back to health.  By the middle of summer Breezie John was back to health, and we rode from dawn to dusk in perfect harmony. That little horse packed me all over Kitsap County, sharing salami and white bread sandwiches with me as we rode along.

      The awesome feeling that Iâ€™ve got from rescuing Breezing John has influenced my life ever since. I realized then my calling in life: helping and rehabilitating both animals and humans. I have been doing that ever since. I try to only take in one to two rescues a year in order to dedicate my full attention, time and love to their rehabilitation. When animals are recovered, I do my best to find the rescues permanent homes where they will be loved and cared for the rest of their days. Some animals never leave, and I find them a job here on the rancho.  Some become lesson horses whereas others become therapy horses; still some are just here to make you laugh. Through my blood, sweat and tears I have cared for these critters for no other reason than to make their lives full of love, kindness and caring. If I had to describe what I do every day, I would simply say, "I help create a bridge between equines and humans."

      My name is Isabella. I've been riding my whole life and helping mamma rescuing animals since I remember myself. I like to ride and help heal the horses and donkeys.  I'm so light I usually get to ride them first.  I want to train horses when I grow up.
